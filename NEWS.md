Introduces a code of conduct and new test, and includes improvements to documentation, contributor and parameter use.

## New features

* Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
* Add test for model with no arrivals.

## Other changes

* Greatly improved/expanded `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
* Add Tom to `CITATION.cff` and `DESCRIPTION`.

# Stroke capacity planning model: R DES RAP 0.2.0

Introduces `DistributionRegistry` with JSON-based parameters, replacing individual parameter functions and CSV. Also add test coverage, add file path check, and documentation and dependency management updates.

## New features

* Add `DistributionRegistry` and `inst/extdata/parameters.json` (and accompanying data dictionary). Amended the package, validation, tests and `rmarkdown` to work with the new syntax for sampling and changing values (as have removed the individual parameter functions - and also removed the CSV).
* Add coverage (`covr`, `DT`, coverage command in README, and GitHub action).

## Bug fixes

* Add check for non-null file path when `log_to_file=TRUE` in model validation.

## Other changes

* Switched to "all" `renv` snapshot type.
* Update `docs/stress_des.md`.
