\title{Convert LOS mean/sd to lognormal parameters for all patient types.}
\usage{
transform_to_lnorm(los_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{los_list}{Named list. Each element should itself be a list with
elements \code{mean} and \code{sd} (e.g., as produced by
\code{create_asu_los()} or \code{create_rehab_los()}).}
}
\value{
A named list of the same structure, but with elements \code{meanlog}
and \code{sdlog} for each patient type.
}
\description{
Given a named list of length of stay (LOS) distributions (each with
\code{mean} and \code{sd} on the original scale), this function returns a
new named list where each entry contains the corresponding \code{meanlog}
and \code{sdlog} parameters required by R's \code{rlnorm()} and related
functions.
